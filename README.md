## Categories

Each skill declares a `category` in its frontmatter. Categories help users browse the Skills Store and should reflect the user-facing purpose of the skill.

Common categories you’ll see:
- Productivity
- Communication
- Business
- Lifestyle
- Content & Media
- Development
- Data & AI
- Research
- Documentation
- Design
- DevOps
- Testing & Security
- Tools

Use the most specific, user-friendly category that matches the skill’s primary intent. If a skill spans multiple domains, pick the category users would most likely search.
