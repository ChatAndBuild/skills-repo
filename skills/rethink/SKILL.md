# Rethink

Challenge assumptions against evidence and propose improvements.

## When to Use

- Review observations and contradictions
- Re-evaluate system decisions
- Produce a revised approach or plan

## Workflow

1. Collect observations, constraints, and recent changes.
2. List assumptions being made.
3. Test each assumption against evidence.
4. Identify gaps, risks, and alternatives.
5. Propose updates with rationale.

## Output

- Summary of evidence
- Assumptions kept vs. changed
- Recommended actions (ranked)
