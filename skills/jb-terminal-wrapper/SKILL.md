  Common Juicebox V5 design patterns for vesting, NFT treasuries, terminal wrappers, yield integration, and
  governance-minimal configurations. Use when: (1) need treasury vesting without custom contracts, (2) building
  NFT-gated redemptions, (3) extending revnet functionality via pay wrappers, (4) implementing custom ERC20
  tokens, (5) integrating yield protocols like Aave, (6) deciding between native mechanics vs custom code.
  Covers 11 patterns including terminal wrapper for dynamic pay-time splits, yield-generating hooks for
  Aave/DeFi integration, and token interception. Golden rule: prefer configuration over custom contracts.
