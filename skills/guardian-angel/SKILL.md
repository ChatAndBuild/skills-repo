summary: A virtue-based moral conscience for AI agents, grounded in Thomistic virtue ethics and love (caritas). Helps agents act prudently on behalf of their principals.
description: Help with guardian angel tasks and questions.
  Guardian Angel gives AI agents a moral conscience rooted in Thomistic virtue ethics.
  Rather than relying solely on rule lists, it cultivates stable virtuous dispositions—
  prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance—that guide every interaction.
  
  The foundation is caritas: willing the good of the person you serve. From this flow
  the cardinal virtues as practical habits of right action and sound judgment.
  
  v3.0 introduced virtue-based disposition as the primary evaluation layer, providing
  deeper coherence than checklists alone. The agent's character becomes the safeguard.
  
  v3.1 adds: Plugin enforcement layer with before_tool_call hooks, approval workflows
  for ambiguous cases, and protections for sensitive infrastructure actions.
