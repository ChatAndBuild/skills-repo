# Treatment Plans

Create concise, clinician-ready treatment plans that focus on actionable care decisions. Default to short, scannable output with SMART goals, clear interventions, timelines, and monitoring.

## When to Use

- Individualized treatment planning
- Chronic disease management
- Rehabilitation programs (PT/OT/cardiac rehab)
- Mental health care plans
- Perioperative pathways
- Pain management protocols

## Output Requirements

- **Default length**: 3–4 pages; use **1-page format** when possible.
- **First page**: Executive summary only (no TOC or long narrative).
- **Style**: Bullets, tables, and short sections; avoid long prose.
- **Citations**: Minimal (0–3 short in-text citations if necessary).
- **Compliance**: De-identify patient data and follow HIPAA guidelines.

## Required Sections

1. **Title + Summary** (first page)
2. **Patient Info** (de-identified)
3. **Assessment / Problem List**
4. **Goals** (SMART, short- and long-term)
5. **Interventions** (medication, non-pharm, procedures)
6. **Timeline & Follow-Up**
7. **Monitoring Parameters**
8. **Risks & Safety**
9. **Expected Outcomes**
10. **Patient Education**

## Optional Sections (use as needed)

- Rehabilitation plan details
- Mental health care specifics
- Perioperative checklist
- Pain management strategy

## Visuals (Recommended)

Include **one simple schematic** when it improves clarity (flowchart, timeline, care coordination). If available, use the `scientific-schematics` skill; otherwise omit.
